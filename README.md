# Infinite Pangrams
A modified version of NYT's spelling bee where you only try to find pangrams (i'm not good enough at the regular game)

## How to run:
```
git clone https://github.com/alex2tu/infinite-pangrams.git
cd infinite_pangrams
```
You will need to host both the backend and the frontend on a local server, here I will use python

Setting up the frontend:
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Setting up the backend:
```
cd backend
pip3 install
python3 app.py
```
